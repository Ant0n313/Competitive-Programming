# Multiapp Project

## About the project

This program is created for final project in Applied Programming course at 3rd in AAST,Cairo,Egypt 2022 collaborating with [Hussein Hafez](https://github.com/husseinhafez1)

It was required to implement all what we learn during the course

- 2D Arrays

- pointers

- String processing

- Recursion

- Files

Thats why the project have various applications

```bash
The program full built in pure C language with colorful text in console
```

## Project Map & Overview

1. ##### <u>2D Arrays</u>
   
   Doing operations on matricies
   
   1. Sum of **main** and **inverse** digonals
   
   2. **Sum** of two Matrcies
   
   3. **Mutiply** two Matrcies

2. ##### <u>Applications</u>
   
   1. <u>Check Leap Year</u>
      
      by entering the year and validate if it Leap year or not and if not tell you the upcoming Leap year
   
   2. <u>Digital clock</u>
      
      - This app preview the current Clock in 12 hour format 'AM - PM' with making a little beep every one minute
      
      - and Aslo the current Date with *"day d month year"* format
   
   3. <u>Difference Between two time Intervals</u>
      
      - Get the difference between starting and ending time
      
      - by entring time in *hour : minute : seconds*
   
   4. <u>Decimal to binary (vice verca)</u>
      
      - Converting decimal to binary *"Recursively"*
      
      - Binay to decimal

3. #### <u>Games</u>
   
   1. ##### Snake
      
      The game is created in a simple way than others with pretty changing colorful colors and 3 different levels of diffculty with saving the High score every time you play even after closing the program
      
      After each apple eaten
      
      - *10 pts earned*
      
      - *speed of snake increase*
      
      - *length of snake increase*

###### <u>First level</u> (Easy mode)

- Snake can cross the edges and pass to the opposite side of the screen

- Only dies when hit himself

###### <u>Second level</u> (Normal mode)

- The edges of the map now is deadly

- Every 50 pts (5 apples) new dead point in the map in RED

###### <u>Third level</u> (Hard mode)

and it is very creative map with + sign walls in the middle of the map

- Edges and **Walls** of the map is deadly

- Every 50 pts (5 apples) new dead point in the map in RED
