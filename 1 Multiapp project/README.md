# Multiapp Project

## About the project

This program is created for final project in Applied Programming course at 3rd in AAST,Cairo,Egypt 2022 collaborating with [Hussein Hafez](https://github.com/husseinhafez1)

It was required to implement all what we learn during the course

- 2D Arrays

- pointers

- String processing

- Recursion

- Files

Thats why the project have various applications

```bash
The program full built in pure C language with colorful text in console
```

## Project Map & Overview

1. ### <u>2D Arrays</u>
   
   Doing operations on matricies
   
   1. Sum of **main** and **inverse** digonals
   
   2. **Sum** of two Matrcies
   
   3. **Mutiply** two Matrcies

2. ### <u>Applications</u>
   
   1. <u>Check Leap Year</u>
      
   ![check leap year](https://github.com/AntonAshraf/Private-Codes/blob/main/Uploads/check%20leap%20year.png)
      
         You just enter the year and validate if it Leap year or not and if not tell you the upcoming Leap year
   
   2. <u>Digital clock</u>
      
   ![Digital clock](https://github.com/AntonAshraf/Private-Codes/blob/main/Uploads/Digital%20clock.png)
      
           This app preview the current Clock in 12 hour format 'AM - PM' with making a little beep every one minute
      
           and Aslo the current Date with "day d month year" format
   
   3. <u>Difference Between two time Intervals</u>
      
   ![Difference in time](https://github.com/AntonAshraf/Private-Codes/blob/main/Uploads/diffirence%20in%20time.png)
      
           Get the difference between starting and ending time
      
           by entring time in *hour : minute : seconds*
   
   4. <u>Decimal to binary (vice verca)</u>
      
            Converting decimal to binary *"Recursively"*
      
            Binay to decimal

3. ### <u>Games</u>
   
   1. ##### Snake
      
      The game is created in a simple way than others with pretty changing colorful colors and 3 different levels of difficulty 
      Saving the High score every time you play even after closing the program and read it again form _'HighScore.txt'_
      After each apple eaten
      
      - *10 pts earned*
      
      - *speed of snake increase*
      
      - *length of snake increase*

###### <u>First level</u> (Easy mode)

![Easy mode snake](https://github.com/AntonAshraf/Private-Codes/blob/main/Uploads/Easy%20snake.gif)

- Snake can cross the edges and pass to the opposite side of the screen

- Only dies when hit himself

###### <u>Second level</u> (Normal mode)
![Normal mode snake](https://github.com/AntonAshraf/Private-Codes/blob/main/Uploads/Normal%20mode.gif)
- The edges of the map now is deadly

- Every 50 pts (5 apples) new dead point in the map in RED

###### <u>Third level</u> (Hard mode)
![Hard mode snake](https://github.com/AntonAshraf/Private-Codes/blob/main/Uploads/Hard%20mode.gif)
It is very creative map with + sign walls in the middle of the map

- Edges and **Walls** of the map is deadly

- Every 50 pts (5 apples) new dead point in the map in RED

-----------------

   2. ##### Scramble Game
![scramble game](https://github.com/AntonAshraf/Private-Codes/blob/main/Uploads/Scramble%20game.gif)

This game create a random shuffled word and you have to guess the right order of the word until you get it right✅
- It also have three levels of difficulty based on the length of the word that read from _'words.txt'_ file
   - Level 1 from 3 to 4 letters
   - Level 2 from 4 to 7 letters
   - Level 3 from 7 to 15 letters

## The END

Thank you for reading the documetation of the project!

We tried to make the code cleaned as possible and diffirent from others, hope to find that, there was many more fun games and applications that we can add but we was limited by the time⏱️
   - [ ] 2048 game
   - [ ] Tic-Tac-Toe
   - [ ] Dinosour offline game
   - [ ] Connect 4
   - [ ] Morse code (Translate and play sound)
