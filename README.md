5. ###### [Bug Tracking System](https://github.com/AntonAshraf/BugTrackingSystem) "Object Oriented Programming" __Term 6__

    - A bug tracking system is a software application that helps developers track and manage bugs in their software.

      - Have 4 user roles (Developer - Tester - Project Manager - Admin)
      - Each user has a specific permissions
      - Integrated with MySQL database
      - Frontend is implemented using Java Swing
      - Backend done by Maven Project

6. ###### [Numerical Project](https://github.com/AntonAshraf/Numerical-Calculator) "Numerical Methods" __Term 7__

   - A project that implements numerical methods to solve mathematical problems
    Implemented methods include:
     - Root finding methods
     - Interpolation methods
     - Numerical integration
     - Differential equations
     - Matrix operations

7. ###### [Ball & Beam PID Control](https://github.com/AntonAshraf/Ball-Beam-PID-Control.git) "Automatic Control Systems" __Term 7__

  - A ball and beam system is a classic control problem that involves balancing a ball on a beam. The goal is to maintain the ball at a desired position on the beam.
    - PID controller implementation for maintaining ball position.
    - Utilizes a servo motor for beam movement.
    - Incorporates an ultrasonic sensor for ball position detection.
    - Designed on a breadboard setup for easy replication and experimentation.

8. ###### [C-Compiler and SIC Assembler](https://github.com/AntonAshraf/C-Compiler.git)  "System Programming" __Term 7__

    __C-Compiler:__
    - Compiler focuses on parsing and interpreting while loops in C code.
    - Includes syntax analysis, intermediate code generation, and LR parsing.

    __SIC Assembler:__
    - Reads SIC assembly code, generates symbol tables, and produces object programs.
    - Includes example SIC assembly programs and the assembler source code.

9. ###### [TrashFall Game](https://github.com/AntonAshraf/TrashFall-game.git) "Computer Graphics" __Term 8__
  
  - Trashfall Game is an addictive 2D arcade game developed using Python and Pygame
    - The game involves catching falling trash in a bin.
    - The player controls the bin using the arrow keys.
    - The game features multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
    - Includes a high score system to track player progress.
